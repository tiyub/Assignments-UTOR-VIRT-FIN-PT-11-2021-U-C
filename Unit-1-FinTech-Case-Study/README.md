## Overview and origin

Responding to corruption that made possible the 2008 Financial Meltdown, Adam Goldman and Ademar Gonzalez, in 2013 started a digital currency exchange: Insta BT. Renamed later to BitBuy - a division of First Ledger Corporation, angel funded by Murray Goldman and Robert Halpern in April 1, 2019. Series A funded by Berkley Psytech and Vetster. Incorporated in 2016-02-01, is recognized as a leader in secure and simple entry to the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain market in Canada.  

## Business Activities:  

BitBuy is the FinTech manifestation of the founder lead view that government should be divided from the financial system. The transparency at the core of the Blockchain and the agility that Cryptocurrency offers a path to a free(er)-market economy. This trustless financial vision places BitBuy firmly in the Canadian Crypto exchange space with 350,000+ users. Having achieved an industry reputation for safe and easy Crypto access BitBuy has traded $4 Billion dollars to an addressable market of 23+ million Canadians, that currently have Cryptocurrency in Digital Wallets.

BitBuy is a private company revealing little insight to their tech stack. Lateral queries reveal a partnership with Interac e-Transfer, use of UPC: Universal Payment Channel - Blockchain networking that leverages Distributed Ledger, APIs to BitBuy trusted partners and full deposit insurance. Technical parallels can be drawn to competitors in the space namely: CoinBase, Binance, Crypto.com, Kraken, Gemini CEX.io, MyBtc and NDAX. In addition to the app based DCXs including: Robinhood, GeekWallet.

## Recommendations

BitBuy and their position in the burgeoning Canadian Cryptocurrency space are well advised to enhance platform agility: mobile/wearable access, sharpen UI/UX and innovate toward ambient computing: IoT to fortify delivery to their key demograph: those seeking easy access to digital currency.

Defintitions:

* Blockchain<sup><a href="#ref003">3</a></sup>
>A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.
<br><br>
One key difference between a typical database and a blockchain is the way the data is structured. A blockchain collects information together in groups, known as "blocks" that hold sets of information. Blocks have certain storage capacities and, when filled, are closed and linked to the previously filled block, forming a chain of data known as the “blockchain.” All new information that follows that freshly added block is compiled into a newly formed block that will then also be added to the chain once filled.
<br><br>
A database usually structures its data into tables whereas a blockchain, like its name implies, structures its data into chunks (blocks) that are strung together. This data structure inherently makes an irreversible timeline of data when implemented in a decentralized nature. When a block is filled it is set in stone and becomes a part of this timeline. Each block in the chain is given an exact timestamp when it is added to the chain.

* Cryptocurrencies<sup><a href="#ref002">2</a></sup>
>A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation
